# INSTALL / BUILD instructions for Apache Superset (incubating)

# [required] fetch the tarball and untar the source
# change into the directory that was untarred.

# Superset runs best on python3.6
# Also recommended is the latest long term supported node / npm

# Fetch npm dependencies
cd superset/assets/
npm ci

# Build the Javascript bundles
npm run prod

# Back to the root of the repo
cd ../..

# [optional] Superset pulls in quite a lot of dependencies in order
# to connect to other services. You might want to test or run Superset 
# from a virtual env to make sure those dependencies are separated
# from your system wide versions
python3 -m env36
source env36/bin/activate

# [required] building and installing by pip (preferred)
pip install .

# superset --help

# For complementary information read our CONTRIBUTING.md
